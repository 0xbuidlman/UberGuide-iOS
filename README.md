## Intro

It's the project we did for Uber Hackathon China 2016. This is the repo for iOS client.
Using swift and Objective-C.

The project code is 'UberGuide', but since the product name can not contain anything related with Uber, so we name it 'Smart Traveller'.

## What's this for? 

This idea comes from some single foreign travellers across the world. Based on Uber's internationality, when we try to explore the culture and something else with a new place we've never been before, Uber can help you connect with the city very convenient and comfortable. Without searching for a map in your own language and trying to understand it, you only need to choose the aspect which you want to know end explore about the place you are, and press the beging button directly, then Uber will come for you, no matter where you are, even if you can't communicate with the driver, Uber can find you!

So we build a simple App based on this idea, in order to create a better user experience for travellers all around the world, giving them simple and comfortable way to explore about the city. Users will constantly receive messages about the place they are passing by on the Uber, they don't know where exactly they are heading for, only if they get close to the destination will we tell them what the place is and all the detailed information about it.

Exploration of a city is what Uber API can bring us, more amazing, more convenient, more comfortable.

## Tech Details

The client is written in Swift and Objective-C, using CocoaPod to manage third party services. Some frameworks have huge files, so we added it into the gitignore and you should download and import them into the project manually.  `AVOSCloud.framework` [Download here](https://leancloud.cn/docs/sdk_down.html). Only if you add these two static framework can you build the project and build the bridge-file between Swift and Objective-C.
